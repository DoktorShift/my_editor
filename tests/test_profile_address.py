"""Pins showing a member's Nostr address on their profile.

What must hold (the membership window relies on these outcomes):

  The new profile keeps every field it had (name, picture, lightning
  address, fields MyEditor does not know) and only sets the address
  (shown).

  A profile that already shows the address is left alone and nothing is
  signed (already).

  No profile found (no_profile), or none could be read (unreadable):
  nothing is published, because a profile holding only an address would
  replace the person's name and picture everywhere.

  A signer that says no, or relays that will not take it, change nothing
  (failed).
