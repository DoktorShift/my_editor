"""Runs a script that builds the whole window in a child process, with a
home folder of its own.

The app keeps its settings, session, crash backups and logs in the home
folder, and a test must never read or touch the real ones, nor find what
another test left there. Python finds the home folder in HOME on macOS
and Linux but in USERPROFILE on Windows, so both point at the test's
folder.

The child draws offscreen, where a window is active as soon as it asks
to be, so keys and shortcuts reach it the same way on every system, and
with the system's fonts (``offscreen_fonts``, which the test run itself
uses too). It lets go of the clipboard before it ends
(``release_clipboard``, as the test run does).

The script gets the repository folder and ``args`` as its arguments and
prints its result as one line: ``RESULT`` and the JSON.
