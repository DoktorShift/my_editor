"""Pins when an article says it was published (NIP-23 ``published_at``).

What must hold:

  ``published_at`` is the time of the first publication. Publishing a
  new version of an article (the same identifier) keeps it: from the
  draft the tab came from when that draft carries it, from what this
  computer remembers of its own publications, otherwise from the version
  already on the relays (those the author publishes to, reads from, and
  the indexers).

  Nothing found counts as a new article, dated now, when at least one of
  the author's write relays answered (and an indexer, where there are
  indexers): relays fail all the time, and one that is down must not
  turn every new article into a question. Only when no write relay
  answered at all is the evidence too thin; then the person decides, and
  Cancel signs nothing (review F3: an edit got today's date).

  The reviewer's two live cases (the article's only relay down while
  another of the author's relays answers; the author's relay list moved
  to relays that never had it) keep the date on the computer that
  published the article: its record answers before any relay is asked,
  and a draft saved after publishing carries the date to other devices.
