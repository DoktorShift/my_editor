"""
Crash recovery: debounced backup files for every open editor.

Each editor gets an EditorBackup instance that writes a JSON snapshot
to ~/.cache/my_editor/backups/ a few seconds after the last keystroke.
On a normal close the backup is deleted; on a crash it survives and is
restored silently on the next launch.

Snapshots are HTML, not plain text. A plain-text snapshot restored over
an .html original and saved erased every image in the document, which is
the one thing a crash-recovery feature must never do. The record carries
a version so a build that predates this format leaves a newer file
alone, and a source mtime so a backup older than the file on disk can be
recognised and restored as a copy instead of overwriting newer work.

HTML keeps every typed character, but not everything around it: quote
levels, code blocks (with their language) and inline code come back as
plain paragraphs and plain words. The record keeps those few things in a
small list of its own ("structure": per paragraph, and the stretches of
inline code), and the restore puts them back over the HTML, once the
restored text is checked to be the very text they were taken from.
Restoring from Markdown instead would read typed text as Markdown: a
typed <br> would cut the document there. An older build ignores the list
and restores the HTML; a record from a build that kept Markdown instead
is restored from that only when it gives back exactly the HTML's text.
