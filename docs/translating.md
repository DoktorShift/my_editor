# Translating MyEditor

MyEditor shows every word in the reader's language. English is built in; other languages live in `locale/<language>.po`, the standard gettext format that [Poedit](https://poedit.net), Weblate and most translation tools read and write. There is no compile step: the app reads the `.po` file when it starts.

The language follows the operating system (View > Language > System Language), or the one chosen in that menu. A change applies the next time MyEditor starts.

## Add a language

1. Copy `locale/de.po` to `locale/<code>.po` (the two-letter code, for example `fr.po`), and change its `Language:` and, if your language needs it, `Plural-Forms:` header.
2. Empty every `msgstr` and translate. Poedit opens the file directly.
3. Add the language's own name to `LANGUAGE_NAMES` in `i18n.py` (for example `"fr": "Français"`).
4. Run `python scripts/i18n.py check`. It lists every text that is still missing or whose placeholders differ from the English.
5. Start MyEditor with `MYEDITOR_LANGUAGE=<code>` to see it without changing the setting, and look at every window for text that is cut off.

## Keep a translation up to date

After code changes, run:

```sh
python scripts/i18n.py update
```

It rewrites `locale/myeditor.pot` from the code and brings every `.po` up to date: new texts appear untranslated, translations of texts that still exist are kept, and texts the code no longer uses are dropped. The test suite runs `scripts/i18n.py check`, so a missing German translation or a wrong placeholder fails the tests.

## Rules for the code

- Wrap every text a person sees: `_("Save")`, `ngettext("{n} file", "{n} files", n)`, `pgettext("verb", "Open")` for a word that translates differently depending on what it means, and `N_("Save")` for a text written in one place (a constant) and shown in another, which then calls `_()` on it.
- Write placeholders as `{name}` and fill them after the lookup: `_("Saved {path}").format(path=path)`. Never pass an f-string to `_()`: it would be looked up with the values already in it and never found (`scripts/i18n.py check` reports it).
- Give translators whole sentences. Do not build a sentence from pieces (`_("Saved") + " " + name`); word order differs between languages.
- Do not translate what is not language: file extensions, protocol names in code, key names in settings files, log messages, the membership service's answers (`sidecar/`).
- `i18n.install()` runs before the modules that hold texts are imported (see `main.py`), so a text in a module constant is translated too.

## Make room for longer words

A German text is often a third longer than the English one. Every window must still show all of it:

- Labels that can grow wrap (`setWordWrap(True)`) instead of having a fixed width.
- Windows built on `nostr/ui/assistant.py` grow to fit their text by themselves.
- Check new windows with the pseudo language, which makes every text about 40 percent longer and marks it with brackets: `MYEDITOR_LANGUAGE=pseudo python main.py`. A bracket that is cut off is a text that would be cut off in a translation.

## German style guide

The German translation should read like a well-made German app, in the everyday language people in Germany, Austria and Switzerland use. It follows Apple's German conventions where they are common usage.

- Address the reader with **du** ("Möchtest du die Änderungen speichern?"), as the EINUNDZWANZIG community does.
- Buttons and menu items use the infinitive: "Speichern", "Abbrechen", "Nicht jetzt", "Weiter", "Zurück". Capitalization follows German grammar (nouns capitalized), not English title case.
- A menu item or button that opens a window before acting ends in " …" with a space before it, as in macOS: "Speichern unter …", "Öffnen …".
- Quotation marks: „so“.
- No em dash and no en dash used as a dash: use a colon, parentheses, a comma or a new sentence.
- Plain words, no jargon: no NIP numbers, no "kind 1", no "bolt11" in the interface, exactly as in English.
- Numbers and amounts: "21.000 Sats", "5 GB", "1 GB pro Datei".
