"""When the articles published from this computer first went out.

NIP-23 makes ``published_at`` the time of an article's first
publication, and every later version keeps it. The relays that hold the
article are asked first, but they can be down, or the account's relay
list can have moved since; then the date this computer remembers keeps
an edit from being dated today. Kept per author and identifier in
``~/.config/my_editor/article_first_published.json``, the earliest date
known for each.
