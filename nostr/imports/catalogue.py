"""Which posts are already imported: the rule both apps follow.

A post counts as imported (and is never imported again, so a draft the
person edited is never overwritten, and a deleted one never comes back)
when, for the account and the post's identifier, any of these exists:

1. a draft wrap (kind 31234, also one whose content was blanked to
   delete it), or a plain article draft (kind 30024);
2. a published article (kind 30023);
3. a deletion request (kind 5) naming the draft or the article;
4. an entry in this computer's ledger (inbox_store.py), which keeps a
   post imported after its draft expired on the relays.

EINUNDZWANZIG STANDUP answers the same question from its server. This
app has no server, so :class:`ExistingCatalogue` asks the relays: the
relays the account's drafts are written to (and read from) for drafts
and deletions, its outbox for articles, plus the DraftStore (drafts
already loaded, and deletions it saw) and the ledger.

It asks in requests every relay accepts: ``CHUNK`` identifiers a
request, at most two filters (NIP-11 lets a relay cap the filters of a
request; rnostr allows ten, and a request past that is refused), one
request after the other.

It fails closed: an answer counts for the drafts only when one of the
relays drafts are written to answered it (a fallback relay that has
nothing proves nothing), and when any request goes unanswered the
answer is "unavailable", never "nothing found", and an import does not
start. An event counts only when the account signed it.

What was found is judged once every request is answered: a draft or an
article a deletion request covers (nostr/deletion.py: a version no newer
than the request) counts as removed, though a relay that ignores the
request still hands it out; a version newer than the request counts as
what it is.
