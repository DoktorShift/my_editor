"""The person's sources, synced as one encrypted kind 30078 event.

The list is shared with EINUNDZWANZIG STANDUP: same event (``d`` =
``einundzwanzig:feed-sources``), same payload, same ``["encrypted",
"nip44"]`` tag (feed_list.py describes the payload and the merge). A
source followed in one app shows up in the other, and neither app's
edits are lost to the other's.

Disciplines:

- Optimistic local update, and a JSON cache file per account for an
  instant first paint. The cache also keeps the version last seen on
  the relays and whether local edits still have to go out, so edits
  made just before quitting are sent on the next launch.
- Debounced publish, so rapid edits become one signed event (one
  signer prompt, not five).
- Merge, never overwrite: before publishing, the newest list is read
  again and both apps' edits since the last sync are merged
  (feed_list.merge). A relay answer that arrives while a publish is on
  its way is merged the same way, so it cannot undo an edit.
- Only a newer list counts: the store remembers which event the last
  list seen came from (its time, then its id, as NIP-01 orders
  replaceable events), and a copy that is not newer (a slow or fallback
  relay that kept an old one) neither adds nor removes anything.
- No answer is never "no list": a read counts only when one of the
  account's own relays answered it. Without that, nothing is published
  (the change waits, here and in the cache, for a read that is
  answered), and the old list of this app is not marked as merged.
- A list this app cannot read (saved with older encryption, or the
  signer is unreachable) is never written over: that would delete the
  other app's sources. The edits stay here until it can be read.
- Only real changes are published. A source's last read time travels
  along with one, or when the person opens a manual source; automatic
  checks never cause a publish (a signer prompt each time).
- The list this app wrote before (``myeditor:feed-sources``) is merged
  into the shared one once per account, and never written again.
- ``flush()`` for sign-out and quit, and :meth:`wait_until_settled` so
  quitting can wait (a few seconds at most) for it to arrive.

Every external boundary (queries, publishing, signer, timer, clock,
cache path) is injectable, so the whole store is testable without
relays, a signer, or wall-clock time.
