"""Who writes an article with its author, added and removed the same way
in Article Details and in Publish as Article, and how the zaps to it are
shared between them.

A co-author is chosen with the window's person picker; the author is
never their own co-author, and nobody is added twice. A co-author is
credited and receives no zaps until given a share (nostr/zap_shares.py:
whole percentages, the author keeping what the others leave); one
removed gives their share back to the author. A co-author whose profile
has no lightning address can't receive zaps and gets no share: each is
asked about once (``can_receive_zaps``), counted in until answered, and
asked again the next time when no relay answered.
