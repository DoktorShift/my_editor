"""Starting the app just far enough to prove a build is whole.

``my-editor --self-test`` loads the app (which imports nearly every module)
and checks the pieces a frozen build can lose: translations and icons left out
of the bundle, a Qt module or the TLS backend missing, a library whose
native part did not come along. It prints one line per check and exits with
0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise. The release workflow runs it on each
build before packaging, so a broken bundle never becomes an installer.

A Windows build has no console, so the report also goes to the file named
by ``MYEDITOR_SELF_TEST_REPORT`` when that is set.
